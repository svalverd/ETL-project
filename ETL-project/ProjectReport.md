Mass Shootings in 2018 and 2019

Project Description

My project was to examine whether mass shootings are becoming more numerous and deadly in the states across the country using the most recent data available.

Data sets used:
- https://www.kaggle/gunviolencearchive/gun-violence-database
- http://www.gunviolencearchive.org

Steps for Extraction, Transformation, and Loading

- I pulled data for years 2018 and 2019 to compare mass shootings in each state
- I extracted the data from these two sources and loaded it into my Jupyter notebook
- In Jupyter notebook I did data cleaning and transformation.  Specifically, I dropped some columns and renamed columns.
- I created tables in Postgres and made a connection to the database from Jupyter notebook and loaded the data frames
